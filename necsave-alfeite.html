<h3>Prior to the demo</h3>
	<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Create an area, of about 180 x 250 meters. Call it "RO3_survey"
	<li>Create an area, rotated 90 degrees of about 180 x 250 meters. Call it "HET_survey"
	<li>Check that test 09_Heterogeneous has NP2 moving underwater and "Simple" planner mode
	</ul>

<h3>Heterogeneous ScanArea</h3>
	<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Send RHIB to entrance of the base to provide safety
	<li>Place NP1, Durius and NP2 in the area to be surveyed (station keeping). NP1 north, Durius middle and NP2 south
	<li>Make sure no necsave platforms are running.
	<li>Clear Necsave messages and platforms.
	<li>Start etc/SeaTrials/09_Heterogeneous configuration on NP1, NP2, Durius and GCS.
	<li>Wait for platforms to connect
	<li>Stop station keeping on all platforms.
	<li>Send necsave mission to platforms (ENV_SURVEY), "het_survey", "Heterogeneous Scan Area Demo".
	<li>After the demo completes, stop NECSAVE on all platforms.
	</ul>

<h3>Pattern Formation</h3>
	<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Add a mine danger area in the map close to the subs pier
	<li>Create a path plan from a place close to the platforms over the MDA and into subs pier - call it "MDA_PATH"
	<li>Bring Durius, NP1 and NP2 closer together, having Durius facing the subs pier in the front of the AUVs
	<li>Make sure no necsave platforms are running.
	<li>Clear Necsave messages and platforms.
	<li>Start etc/SeaTrials/08_PF configuration on NP1, NP2, Durius and GCS.
	<li>Check that the plan is still valid and change (if needed)
	<li>Wait for platforms to connect
	<li>Stop any plans currently running on the platforms.	
	<li>Send necsave mission "AREA_SWEEP", "MDA_PATH", "Triangle", Leader=durius, F1 = north platf, F2 = south platf, "PF DEMO"
	<li>After the demo completes, stop NECSAVE on all platforms
	<li>Send Durius to recovery position	
	</ul>

<h3>RO3 Mesh</h3>
	<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Make sure no necsave platforms are running.
	<li>Clear Necsave messages and platforms.
	<li>Send XT2, NP1 and NP2 into operational area, near the manta gateway (station keeping).
	<li>Start etc/SeaTrials/07_RO3_Mesh configuration on NP1, NP2, XT2 and GCS.
	<li>Wait for platforms to connect
	<li>Stop Station Keeping on NP1, NP2 and XT2	
	<li>Send necsave mission (ENV_SURVEY), "RO3_SURVEY", "RO3 Mesh Demo"	
	<li>Open MeshStatePanel
	<li>After the demo completes, stop NECSAVE on all platforms
    <ul>
